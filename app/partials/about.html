<div id="about">
	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I used this task/note taking app as a way to learn a few new front-end technologies. It includes a few CSS3 animations, CSS written in and compiled from LESS, and most importantly it was created with <a href="http://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a>.</p>
	<p>You may have noted that the data doesn't persist across sessions. This is because I wanted to focus entirely on the front end for this project. My next step is looking at the most valuable languages and databases for managing the back end stuff, and then applying those to a new version of this app.</p>
	<p>If you have any thoughts on what I've done here, hints to help me build something better next time, please do let me know! <a href="mailto:me@callummr.com">Email</a> or a <a href="http://twitter.com/callummr" target="_blank">tweet</a> is most likely to catch my attention! Cheers.</p>
